# Gatsby website

## Rationale
* Ostentatious, Gold
  * Animations
  * Everything is for show
* Gold can't be made real
* Pulsing light as the site loads
* Minimum waiting time (2.5sec) to symbolize Gatsby's waiting
* background animation shows there's always movement

## Roadmap
* Make components in React
* `components/` directory currently has Navbar.js, which isn't used
